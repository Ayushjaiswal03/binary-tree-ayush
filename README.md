1 - I collaborated with an AI assistant to accelerate my thinking, but every architectural decision—from reducer extraction to      accessibility—was mine. I used the assistant like I’d use any tool or teammate: to sharpen my execution.

# binary Tree — Ayush Jaiswal

This project is a personalized extension of an open-source React tree component originally published by Hinge Health under the MIT license. I restructured the codebase, added key features like expand/collapse and node removal, and optimized it for performance and scalability. It serves as a showcase of my frontend engineering skills, architectural thinking, and readiness for Staff-level interviews.

## Features

- Recursive tree rendering with `useReducer`
- Expand/Collapse nodes
- Remove nodes dynamically
- Lazy loading simulation for large trees
- Clean separation of reducer logic and UI
- Accessibility-friendly markup

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
